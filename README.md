### Description
This impulse response measurement utility has been built in the Matlab App Designer. It requires
Matlab 2018a (or newer) to run.

The current version (1a) requires the 'playrec' utility to run. This is an external MEX file,
obtained here:

* http://www.playrec.co.uk/ 
	* The repo here includes 2 example compiled MEX files that work ok for most 64 bit macOS and Windows systems.

### Tech summary
The utility uses the exponential sine sweep method (ESS) to obtain the impulse response of, for
example, a room or music hall. It requires the use of an external sound card, typically over USB
(e.g. RME Fireface, Focusrite 2i2), relevant microphones, and a powered loudspeaker.

### How to use MikIRAM
A series of 3 short introductory videos that explain how to install and use MikIRAM (from back when
it was called MikRIR...):
